Cow Bull Game.
Let me start with a WOW!
I think its amazing that after so little time studying javascript you managed to create such a great game!
The styling is fantastic, the code is very orginised and divided well.
All your comments make it easy to understand and that is great when working in a team.
It looks like you did this one all by yourself ,which is what makes this even more impressive.
Your use of functions, dom manipulation, loops and conditionals is excellent.
Great job!!!
